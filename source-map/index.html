    <h1>Source map example</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Open your browser's console window and go to the Debug/Sources tab.</li>
      <li>Select the <code>app.lua</code> file from the list and you should see the Lua source code that is running.</li>
      <li>Add a breakpoint to line 3.</li>
      <li>Refresh the page.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Execution will stop at the breakpoint and you should be able to step through the source from there.
      In Firefox you can blackbox the Starlight runtime code so that you only see your Lua source being executed.

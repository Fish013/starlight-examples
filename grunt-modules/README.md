# grunt-modules

An example of using modules and `require()` in `grunt-starlight` to precompile a set of Lua scripts into JavaScript and use in a webpage.


## Instructions.

Navigate to the `grunt-modules` directory in a terminal, then install dependencies and run the build. 
This will compile `/src/app.lua` to `/dist/app.lua.js`. 

```
npm install
grunt
```

When the build is successful, view `/index.html` in your browser and you should see a form to calculate Fibonacci numbers.

# grunt-hello-world

A simple example that uses `grunt-starlight` to precompile a Lua script into JavaScript and use in a webpage.


## Instructions.

Navigate to the `grunt-hello-world` directory in a terminal, then install dependencies and run the build. 
This will compile `/src/app.lua` to `/dist/app.lua.js`. 

```
npm install
grunt
```

When the build is successful, view `/index.html` in your browser and you should see "Hello world!!" repeated in different colours.
